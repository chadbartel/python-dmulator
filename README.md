# python-dmulator

The DMulator is a Python wrapper for the pen and paper game, Dungeons and Dragons. It will be designed with the Dungeon Master (DM)
in mind. That is, it will be available to do all the heavy-lifting for the DM that is too time-consuming.

Eventually, this will be implemented in a GUI and/or ported over to C#.
